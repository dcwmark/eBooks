While you cannot use the standard "File" > "Download" option because the link is a *published* web link (indicated by `/pub?`) which typically restricts downloading, you can use a common workaround to save it as a *PDF* or *HTML* file.

💡 *Workaround: Save as PDF via HTML View*

1. *Modify the URL*: Take the link you provided and replace the entire ending, starting from `/pub?`, with `/htmlpresent`.
  * *Original Link*: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQXZJuZoBEWFhl9sL4QMdT0ZS7urPfAhVG-LXNFPyln3fNSX8fBEKcHdcVbsQ2rrQDUbQyCKuJGPtou/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g34e80527291_1_10382
  * *Modified Link*: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQXZJuZoBEWFhl9sL4QMdT0ZS7urPfAhVG-LXNFPyln3fNSX8fBEKcHdcVbsQ2rrQDUbQyCKuJGPtou/htmlpresent
1. *Open the New URL*: Paste the modified link into your browser and press Enter. This will load a simplified view with all slides stacked vertically.
1. *Print to PDF*:
  * On your computer, press *Ctrl+P* (Windows) or *Cmd+P* (Mac) to open the print dialog.
  * Under the "Destination" or "Printer" option, select *Save as PDF* or *Microsoft Print to PDF*.
  * Click Save.

This will create a PDF of the entire presentation.
